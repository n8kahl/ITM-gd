### Sample 9: Refund Request

Sample visitor question: "Can I get a refund if I don’t like it?"  
Recommended AI response:

Reason: Negative sentiment.

## 6) Escalation Rules (When Human Takes Over)

The system escalates to human support when one or more of the following is detected:

1. Visitor explicitly asks for a human.
2. Purchase-intent / high-value signals (ready to buy, premium tier interest, mentorship interest).
3. Billing/refund/cancellation concerns.
4. Negative sentiment (frustrated/angry language).
5. Extended back-and-forth where human support is better.
6. Manual takeover by team member in admin panel.

### Email Gate Before Full Handoff

If escalation is needed and email is missing:

1. AI asks for contact email.
2. Escalation is marked as pending.
3. Once email is provided, handoff is completed for human follow-up.

## 7) Guardrails for AI Responses

- AI should only use approved facts from system prompt + knowledge base.
- AI must not invent win rates, performance claims, customer counts, or policy terms.
- AI must keep Cohort and Private 1-on-1 terms separate:
  - Cohort = 90-day
  - 1-on-1 = 8-week
- AI must use no-refund-obligation language when refund questions are asked.

## 8) Client Review Checklist

Please review and mark any edits needed for:

1. Tone of AI answers (more formal, more friendly, shorter, etc.).
2. Pricing wording clarity.
3. Mentorship positioning clarity (Cohort vs 1-on-1).
4. Refund wording comfort level.
5. Escalation triggers (too aggressive / too passive).
6. Any missing questions your team receives often.

## 9) Suggested Next Improvements

1. Rename any legacy “Execute” wording in older knowledge-base entries to “Executive” for naming consistency.
2. Add 10-15 more approved Q&A entries from real customer conversations.
3. Add monthly review of escalated chats to tune AI responses and handoff timing.
