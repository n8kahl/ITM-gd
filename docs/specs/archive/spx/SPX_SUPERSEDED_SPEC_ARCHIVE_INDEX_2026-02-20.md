# SPX Superseded Spec Archive Index
Date: February 20, 2026

## Purpose
Record superseded SPX command-center planning artifacts and map each one to the current canonical execution packet.

## Canonical Replacement
- `/Users/natekahl/ITM-gd/docs/specs/SPX_COMMAND_CENTER_PRODUCTION_RECOVERY_EXECUTION_SPEC_2026-02-20.md`
- `/Users/natekahl/ITM-gd/docs/specs/spx-production-recovery-autonomous-2026-02-20/README.md`

## Superseded Artifacts (Historical Reference)
1. `/Users/natekahl/ITM-gd/docs/specs/SPX_COMMAND_CENTER_AUTONOMOUS_PROD_SPEC_2026-02-19.md`
   - Superseded by the production recovery execution spec and autonomous packet.
2. `/Users/natekahl/ITM-gd/docs/specs/SPX_COMMAND_CENTER_DEV_SPEC.md`
   - Superseded as an implementation master-plan by slice-based autonomous execution docs.
3. `/Users/natekahl/ITM-gd/docs/specs/SPX_SNIPER_COMMAND_CENTER_PROD_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026-02-17.md`
   - Superseded by updated command-center recovery architecture and phased slices.

## Notes
1. Files remain in-place for traceability and historical diff context.
2. New implementation and release decisions must reference canonical replacement docs only.
