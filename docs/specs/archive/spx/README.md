# SPX Spec Archive

This folder tracks superseded SPX planning/spec artifacts that are no longer the canonical execution source.

## Canonical active sources
1. `/Users/natekahl/ITM-gd/docs/specs/SPX_COMMAND_CENTER_PRODUCTION_RECOVERY_EXECUTION_SPEC_2026-02-20.md`
2. `/Users/natekahl/ITM-gd/docs/specs/spx-production-recovery-autonomous-2026-02-20/README.md`
3. Phase slice reports (`SPX_COMMAND_CENTER_PHASE*_SLICE_*.md`) for completed execution evidence.

## Archive governance
1. Do not execute from archived specs.
2. Keep archived docs for historical rationale only.
3. Add a cross-reference entry before archiving newer superseded specs.
