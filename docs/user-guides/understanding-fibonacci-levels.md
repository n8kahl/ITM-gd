# Understanding Fibonacci Levels

Fibonacci retracement levels are price zones traders watch for potential support/resistance after a swing.

## Core Levels
- `23.6%`: shallow pullback in strong trends
- `38.2%`: common retracement level
- `50%`: widely watched midpoint
- `61.8%`: golden ratio, high-priority level
- `78.6%`: deep retracement, trend stress point

## How TITM AI Coach Uses Them
1. Detect recent swing high and swing low.
2. Calculate levels across that range.
3. Combine Fibonacci levels with PDH/PDL, pivots, VWAP, and GEX.
4. Highlight confluence zones where multiple level types align.

## Practical Reading
- If price is rejecting the same Fib level repeatedly, that level is acting as active resistance/support.
- If Fib 61.8% aligns with VWAP or PDH/PDL, treat it as a higher-confidence decision zone.
- Always pair Fib levels with an invalidation point (for example, a close beyond the level).

## On the Chart
- Fib lines appear as `Fib 0%`, `Fib 23.6%`, `Fib 38.2%`, `Fib 50%`, `Fib 61.8%`, `Fib 78.6%`, and `Fib 100%`.
- `38.2%` and `61.8%` are emphasized as major levels.
